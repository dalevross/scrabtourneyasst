This is a test e-mail. Attachment contains a list of Tournament Group Members
as at a couple days ago when I pulled them down to add them to the application. I'll see if I can automate
the synchronization of my database with the group list at some point.
Game links are also included. The plan is to automate emailing of signups/game statuses for the big one.
I'm having fun!!
<br/>&quot;Beware, you have incurred the wrath of the Spacema'm!&quot; :D
