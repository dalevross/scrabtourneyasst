It has been superseded by the DOM extension that ships with PHP 5.

Although it should be possible to use this old domxml extension with PHP 5, its use is highly discouraged, as there a very high potential for conflicts with the new dom extension.

If you really must build domxml, you will need to obtain the sources from CVS and build them yourself.

See http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.pecl.php for instructions.

NOTE: if you're running PHP 4.x, the domxml is already part of the distribution.
